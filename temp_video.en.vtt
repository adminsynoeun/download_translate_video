00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.400
There are many Sacred Sect disciples
in Yongzhou.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.600
Looking at this situation,

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:09.000
what are your thoughts?

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.700
You assisted the Imperial Advisor
in establishing schools.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.066
Yet, Sacred Sect disciples
have no place to study.

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.266
You thought of the world,

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:22.100
but forgot about the Sacred Sect.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.200
You should build Primary School,
Great School,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.966
and Imperial Academy within the sect.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:30.200
Only then can our disciples
keep up with the times.

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.866
This is the work of the Sect Leader,

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.866
not the Patriarch.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.866
Why didn't the former sect leader act?

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.500
He was distracted by his desires

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.666
and enchanted by his wife.

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.800
He lost sight of the greater good.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.533
Here's an idea.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.100
Select the most outstanding disciples
from our sect.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.233
Have them take
the Imperial Academy's exams.

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.500
Let the Imperial Academy
train our disciples for us.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.500
If only you had been born
forty years earlier.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.000
Left and Right Protectors.

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:04.500
Is everyone here?

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.866
The Sect Leader's wife
and the Sacred Lady are still absent.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.933
Among the Four Guardian Kings,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.166
Guardian King Qian has yet to return.

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:14.400
So brazen?

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:15.733
Could it be that

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.800
the Heavely Sacred Sect's headquarters
is in Yongzhou?

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.733
All 360 Halls, unfurle the banners!

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:56.900
Young Sect Leader,

00:01:57.633 --> 00:01:59.966
this is the sacred land
of our Heavely Sacred Sect,

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.000
Sacred Mountain.

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.200
Have Mu and the Patriarch arrived yet?

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.633
Youyou,

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:45.833
be more solemn.

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:47.800
Who told you to reveal your true form?

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.400
It's the child you raised
who's becoming the Sect Leader.

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:53.266
Do you want to
ruin his ascension ceremony?

00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:03.000
That's more like it.

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:04.000
Let's go.

00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:07.200
Grandma.

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:15.200
Sacred Lady Si Yunxiang
greets the Young Sect Leader.

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:16.600
Sacred Lady?

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.733
This generation's Sacred Lady
is much more obedient.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.566
The last one was nothing
but a troublemaker.

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:23.966
- I'm still here!
- Grandma.

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:26.066
You old guy, what are you up to?

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:28.900
Mu,

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:31.100
Yunxiang is from the Si family.

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:33.100
After the Patriarch met her,

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:34.900
he personally taught her
for several years.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.700
No wonder I always felt
she resembled Grandma.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:41.000
Guardian King Qian hasn't arrived yet?

00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:42.800
Not yet.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.900
Investigate.

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:48.700
Treat Guardian King Qian's
descendants well.

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:51.200
Imperial Advisor,

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:52.800
there's unusual activity in Yongzhou.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.400
The Heavenly Demon Sect's leadership
has gathered.

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:56.600
The City Lord's Mansion
has vanished without a trace.

00:03:57.533 --> 00:03:58.466
Understood.

00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:00.100
It's the largest sect of the demon path.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.266
We must stay vigilant.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.633
If you knew
who the Heavenly Demon Sect's Patriarch is,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.800
you wouldn't panic.

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:08.433
The Heavenly Demon Sect's Patriarch?

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.566
he was once the Grand Libationer
of the Imperial Academy.

00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:15.166
The Heavenly Demon Sect's Patriarch
has been in hiding for so long.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.133
Could it be that...

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:17.366
You're overthinking it.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.800
Back then, I traveled far and wide.

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:21.533
I learned from various schools.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.266
But I saw that each sect kept to itself.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.666
They guarded their secrets closely.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.333
This hindered the progress
of mystical powers and Daoist arts.

00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:31.266
So I decided to visit them,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.666
hoping to break down the barriers
between sects.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.133
The first person I met

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.600
was the Patriarch
of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.700
He was the first to set aside
sectarian biases.

00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:45.300
He taught me wholeheartedly

00:04:45.366 --> 00:04:47.566
and showed me the right path.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.333
He even personally recommended me
to meet the Daoist Master.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.633
Because of his letter, the Daoist Master
treated me differently

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:56.800
and allowed me to study
the Fourteen Chapters of the Daoist Sword.

00:04:57.933 --> 00:05:00.700
He was also the one who sent me
to the Great Thunder Sound School,

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:02.900
where I received the Teachings of Rulai.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.233
Though he never revealed his identity,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.833
he couldn't hide it from me.

00:05:08.233 --> 00:05:09.633
He didn't deliberately hide it from me.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.966
(Imperial Academy Hall)
I invited him

00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:12.966
to take over the Imperial Academy.

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:14.866
Not because of his skills.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.700
Nor because he's the Patriarch
of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:21.500
But because of his magnanimity.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.500
I've never met someone
with such a broad and pure heart.

00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:31.700
He's the only one fit
to lead the Imperial Academy.

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:34.300
He's my mentor.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.400
And more than that,
he's my kindred spirit.

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:38.400
If we share the same path,

00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:40.300
why did he resign and leave?

00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:45.600
It must be for the next leader
of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:50.200
I'll personally meet
this new sect leader.

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:52.633
Those who follow will thrive.

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:55.000
Those who oppose will perish.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.733
In the auspicious year,

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:10.900
in the fortunate hour,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.366
Heaven and earth unite,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.300
bringing boundless blessings.

00:06:19.933 --> 00:06:25.633
The disciples of the Heavenly Sacred Sect
welcome the Young Sect Leader's ascension!

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.900
Hail the ascension
of the Young Sect Leader.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.500
Hail the ascension
of the Young Sect Leader!

00:06:44.033 --> 00:06:46.600
Hail the ascension
of the Young Sect Leader!

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:47.866
Patriarch,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.200
why do we call the succession of
our Heavenly Sacred Sect Leader "ascension"?

00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:52.700
Isn't "ascension" a term
used for emperors?

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:55.966
At the peak
of our Heavenly Sacred Sect's glory,

00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:57.666
we governed six nations.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.500
The emperors of those six nations
were all our subjects.

00:07:00.633 --> 00:07:03.766
Thus, the Sacred Sect Leader used
the term "ascension" like an emperor.

00:07:04.233 --> 00:07:06.300
It was quite an honor
for the emperors, really.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.433
Times have changed,

00:07:09.033 --> 00:07:12.300
and now nations
are the most powerful sects.

00:07:12.633 --> 00:07:16.566
A sect can't make everyone its disciple,

00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:17.933
but a nation

00:07:18.133 --> 00:07:19.900
can make everyone within its borders

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:22.300
its citizens.

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:49.200
The Heavenly Demon Sect
has gathered in Yongzhou.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.133
They're likely to appoint a new leader.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.866
They've been in chaos
for over forty years.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.133
The emergence of this new leader

00:07:56.233 --> 00:07:58.300
is no blessing for the people.

00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:00.000
He must be eliminated.

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:01.600
As you command.

00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:05.900
The Imperial Advisor of Yankang follows
the Heavenly Demon Sect's teachings.

00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:08.900
Yankang Nation is essentially
a grand Heavenly Demon Sect.

00:08:08.933 --> 00:08:10.600
What should the Daoist Sect do?

00:08:11.633 --> 00:08:15.900
The Imperial Advisor's ambition
outweighs his abilities.

00:08:16.233 --> 00:08:18.900
History has seen
more exceptional talents than him

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:21.966
and empires grander than Yankang.

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:25.800
Yet they all turned to dust
and the Great Wasteland.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.166
The world is more complex
than he imagines.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.266
He'll understand
once he's shattered into pieces.
